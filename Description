Project is to automate the execution of batch processes on a large scale. In principle the processes are dependent on what to validate the performance of dependent processes. The system Process Control handle alarms with parameters that will allow users to be aware of the execution of processes, take statistics of runtimes and an intelligent rescheduling queue processes so that processes run optimal way so that the runtimes and other system resources are used in the best way. Shall have the following components: Server that performs the execution process programmatically according to AI algorithms. 2. A server queue for handling messages between components. 3. A web application administration processes and lowering and raising contralador daemon and other administrative tasks. 4. Applications notifications to users for mobile devices.
